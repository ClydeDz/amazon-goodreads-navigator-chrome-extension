# Amazon to Goodreads Navigator Chrome Extension
Adds a 1-click 'View in Goodreads' button on Amazon book pages to easily navigate from Amazon to Goodreads when clicked.

## Why?
When I come across a book that I like on Amazon, I immediately want to head over to its Goodreads page and save it to my 'Want to read' list. However, this process is tedious as I have to manually open up Goodreads and search for the book before I can actually click that button.

This Chrome extension removes the need for multiple steps. Just click on the 'View in Goodreads' button to directly open up that book's Goodreads page. Easy as! 

Happy reading!
